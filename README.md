Powershell Summit Pester Session - Pesterize Your Code!!

I will be updating some of the content to reflect one of the questions I received during my session.  The question was how to variablize the inputs that I had hardcoded into my test.  For my OctoEnv module, I had hard coded the environment name into the test, shortly I will have an example that illustrates how to pass parameters into the test itself so you don't have to hard code values, which will make the test far easier to maintain.

I will have that up as soon as I can.

Thanks again for anyone who came to my session!!

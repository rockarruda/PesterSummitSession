Topics to cover

- Why are you pestering me? Why are we writing tests?  Yes I know this has been done to death, lets just recap and talk about the mental blocks, my plane anaology.. flight test checks.
- Where do I start? What helped me to get started..  Writing code in smaller chunks.  I stopped writing big jagunda scripts and modules.. Broke them down into smaller parts, then you just test for those one at a time.  Talk about my struggles with Test Driven Development approach..  I came from Science back ground, we tested by experimenting and I want to solve the problem first.. that is just how I am wired.  I guess in the end.. if you are writing tests that work for their intended purpose to me that is what is important.   Start with what you know(what tests to write first) Just need to get started..
- Now What? 
#- Basics of Pester
#- Simple Functions (Like simple simple)
#- Real World application
#- Simple Module
#- Mocking - more complex functions with remote commands or interacting with Rest APIs

Math teacher analogy... You got homework to do problems 1-55 just the odds.  And ofcourse you know the anwers
for the odds are in the back of the book.  So you go an write down just the answers, and then hand
it in.  Teacher says.. nope you failed.  You want to make sure when executing your tests
it actually is hitting your logic.. Make sure it is doing the work.

Work the tests backwards.. you know what the answer should be, you know what has to be done to get it..
start with that.  start with what you know.

You know what the script/function is going to do, you expect what it should return... Start with that..

Will it test 100% over everything?  No....  Is it testing something.. Yes...

You don't have to have EVERYTHING done before you begin.

Do a Pester test for presentation?  For fun??

Sys Admins - Pester tests for system checks, Testing DSC resources?

Unit Tests and Integration tests?

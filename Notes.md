Math teacher analogy... You got homework to do problems 1-55 just the odds.  And ofcourse you know the anwers
for the odds are in the back of the book.  So you go an write down just the answers, and then hand
it in.  Teacher says.. nope you failed.  You want to make sure when executing your tests
it actually is hitting your logic.. Make sure it is doing the work.

Work the tests backwards.. you know what the answer should be, you know what has to be done to get it..
start with that.  start with what you know.

You know what the script/function is going to do, you expect what it should return... Start with that..

Will it test 100% over everything?  No....  Is it testing something.. Yes...

You don't have to have EVERYTHING done before you begin.
